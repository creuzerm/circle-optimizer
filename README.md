# Circle Packing Optimizer

A high-performance web-based utility designed to maximize the yield of circular parts from rectangular material sheets. Built with React and Tailwind CSS, this tool uses hexagonal (honeycomb) packing algorithms to provide significantly higher density than standard grid-based layouts.

## 🚀 Features

* **Hexagonal Packing Logic**: Calculates the most efficient honeycomb arrangement to minimize wasted space.
* **Real-time Preview**: Instant visual feedback as you adjust material size, circle diameter, margins, and gaps.
* **Yield Comparison**: Automatically compares optimized results against standard grid packing to show percentage gains.
* **Dual-Unit Support**: Seamlessly switch between Imperial (inches) and Metric (mm) units with automatic value conversion.
* **SVG Export**: Download production-ready vector files (`.svg`) for use in laser cutters, CNC routers, or vinyl cutters.
* **Responsive Design**: Fully functional on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

## 📐 The Math

Standard grid packing () often leaves significant gaps between rows. This optimizer utilizes a **Hexagonal Tiling** approach where:

* Circles in even rows are offset by  (radius).
* The vertical distance between rows is reduced to  (approximately  diameter).
* The tool automatically calculates if a **90-degree rotation** of the entire pattern yields more units based on the aspect ratio of the material.

## 🛠️ Usage

1. **Select Material**: Choose from presets (A4, 12x24", etc.) or enter custom dimensions.
2. **Set Diameter**: Input the exact size of the circular parts you need to produce.
3. **Adjust Safety Margins**: Define how much space is needed from the edge of the sheet.
4. **Set Minimum Gap**: Define the "kerf" or bridge thickness required between parts for structural integrity during cutting.
5. **Download**: Click "Download SVG" to save the layout.

## 💻 Tech Stack

* **Framework**: React 18 (via CDN)
* **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
* **Icons**: Custom Inline SVGs (Optimized for React compatibility)
* **Deployment**: Single-file HTML (No build step required)
